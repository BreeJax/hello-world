# hello-world
The first repository of Bree Jackson, as requested by the great and powerful octocat, original Hogwarts level homework given by the Iron Yard.
This is the part of the project where I'm meant to write a bit about myself, so here we go!
I'm the oldest of five, I like reading and writing, and I miss being good at math. I've been trying to work up to being able to do something called fire spinning, but I'm not sure if I'll ever get there. Still trying. I've been trying to get back into making things out of recycled material, but it's hard. Born in 1992, I'm a Hufflepuff through and through. 
My classmates will be able to tell which bag is mine VERY easily.
